# Core file I/O — FileIO, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, BufferedRandom, TextIOWrapper.
# Direct read/write/open syscalls in C, bypassing posix module.
# Almost every Python program touches file I/O through this module.
#
# Needs patch_class wrappers for readinto/readinto1 on FileIO, BufferedReader,
# BufferedRandom, BufferedRWPair (see Buffer Protocol section in MODULES_GUIDE.md).

# TODO
